GENERAL INFO FOR ANY READER 
****************************

**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**

This program was created to polish and improve my C# programming skills.
This was created in several languages in my repository of code to show the differences in each language with the same functionality.

This script uses Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe Formula (BBP Formula) to calculate PI to the nth digit.
		
If you don't know the BBP formula see this wiki link:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula
		
It starts off by waiting for user input. 
In the textbox on the screen you input a number and hit "Calculate" button to calculate PI to nth digit!
Make sure it is below 10 otherwise it will throw an error to say it should be between 0-10.
