GENERAL INFO FOR ANY READER 
****************************

**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**

This program was created during my 1st year of Software Engineering at University of Guelph.
It is a very simple script for an assignment in my CIS*1500 class.
Since this is a script I did in 1st year of University, this is not a current representation of my skill after graduating University of Guelph in Software Engineering.

The script is on Body mass index (BMI), if you don't know what that is, see below link:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index

The program will get the height and weight from the user, and after print out all the information back to the user.
The last thing it will print out is the BMI algorithm that was given in class by the professor and was implemented into the code.
