GENERAL INFO FOR ANY READER 
****************************

**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**

This program was created to polish and improve my C programming skills during my spare time.
This was created in several languages in my repository of code to show the differences in each language with the same functionality.
		
The script is on Metric Conversion, if you don't know what that is, see below link:
www.metric-conversions.org/length/kilometers-to-meters.htm
		
The program will calculate Kilometre to Metre, and Metre to Kilometre.
		
It starts off by waiting for user input with a menu displayed to the user.
Menu:
	1) Kilometre to Metre (km to m)
	2) Metre to Kilometre (m to km)
	3) Quit the program (q)
Choosing an option from the menu will allow you to do a specific conversion and ask for more input.
Once it gives you the result from the conversion it will return you to the menu.
	
The program has error checking to determine if the input from user was valid or not.
