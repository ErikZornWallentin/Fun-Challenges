GENERAL INFO FOR ANY READER 
****************************

**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**

This program was created during my 1st year of Software Engineering at University of Guelph.
It is a very simple script for an assignment in my CIS*1500 class.
Since this is a script I did in 1st year of University, this is not a current representation of my skill after graduating University of Guelph in Software Engineering.

The script is a simple lottery checker that takes input from the user to set everything and after compare their results.
Everything is fake and has limited functionality as requested by the assignment.

When the program runs it will ask the user for input for the shown menu.
You have several options to choose from:
	n) Enter your name and jackpot amount
	w) Enter winning number
	t) Enter ticket numbers
	e) Check to see if you won!
	q) Quit the program
	
Program has sleep commands so it is slow, please check for the feedback as it will make sure you gave proper input before moving onto next menu options.
This script has limited error checking functionality.
