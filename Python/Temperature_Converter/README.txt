GENERAL INFO FOR ANY READER 
****************************

**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**

This program was created to polish and improve my Python programming skills during my spare time.
This was created in several languages in my repository of code to show the differences in each language with the same functionality.
		
The script is on Temperature Conversion, if you don't know what that is, see both links:
http://www.rapidtables.com/convert/temperature/how-celsius-to-fahrenheit.htm
http://www.metric-conversions.org/temperature/fahrenheit-to-celsius.htm
		
The program will calculate Fahrenheit to Celsius, and Celsius to Fahrenheit.
		
It starts off by waiting for user input with a menu displayed to the user.
Menu:
	1) Fahrenheit to Celsius (F to C)
	2) Celsius to Fahrenheit (C to F)
	3) Quit the program (q)
Choosing an option from the menu will allow you to do a specific conversion and ask for more input.
Once it gives you the result from the conversion it will return you to the menu.
	
The program has error checking to determine if the input from user was valid or not.
