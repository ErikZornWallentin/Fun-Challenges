GENERAL INFO FOR ANY READER 
****************************

**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**

This program was created to polish and improve my Java programming skills.
This was created in several languages in my repository of code to show the differences in each language with the same functionality.

The script is on Temperature Conversion, if you don't know what that is, see both links:
http://www.rapidtables.com/convert/temperature/how-celsius-to-fahrenheit.htm
http://www.metric-conversions.org/temperature/fahrenheit-to-celsius.htm

The program will calculate Fahrenheit to Celsius, and Celsius to Fahrenheit.
The program also handled error checking, it will give an error on blank input, or characters.

It starts off by waiting for user input. 
In both textbox's on the screen you input a number and hit "Calculate" button to calculate Temperature Conversion!
You can reset the converter at any time to get back to the original state that the program started in.
