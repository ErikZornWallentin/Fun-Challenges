**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**

I was bored, and wanted to keep my JavaScript programming skills sharpened over time, so I made this Heads and Tails script!

The code contains HTML and Javascript that you can review in the Heads_Tails.html file.

Double click (open) the file called Heads_Tails.html in a browser so you can play Heads and Tails!

This program was created for fun during my reading week break in University during 3rd year.
		
This game is Heads and Tails coin flip.
		
It starts off by waiting for user input in one of the squares and asks for you to choose either Heads or Tails button.
Once you choose one, you are compared against the AI's choice and the winner / loser is determined.
You can continue to keep playing, reset at any time, and all error checking is handled.
		
Enjoy!
