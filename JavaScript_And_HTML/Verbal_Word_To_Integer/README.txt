Running the program(s) and GENERAL INFO FOR ANY READER 
*********************************************************************

**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**


This program was created to polish and improve my JavaScript programming skills.
		
This script is on Verbal Number Conversion, if you don't know what that is, see below link:
https://www.ego4u.com/en/cram-up/vocabulary/numbers/cardinal
		
Example use:
	one hundred and six ---> "Calculate" --> 106
	one hundred and sixty-six ---> "Calculate" --> 166
		
		
The program will calculate english verbal numbers into normal numbers
The program also handled error checking, it will give an error on blank input, or numbers.
It assumes you gave proper english verbal numbers, as some cases it will be accepted if incomplete sentences,
as some keywords are still accepted.
		
It starts off by waiting for user input. 
In both textbox's on the screen you input a number and hit "Calculate" button to calculate Verbal Number Conversion!
You can reset the converter at any time to get back to the original state that the program started in.
		
Enjoy!
