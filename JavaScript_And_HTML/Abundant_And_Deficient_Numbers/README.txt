**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**


This program was created to polish and improve my JavaScript programming skills.
		
This is script is on Abundant and Deficient Number, if you don't know what that is, see below link:
http://www.positiveintegers.org/IntegerTables/1-100
		
Example use's:
	Consider the number 21. Its divisors are 1, 3, 7 and 21, and their sum is 32. 
	Because 32 is less than 2 x 21, the number 21 is deficient. 
	Its deficiency is 2 x 21 - 32 = 10.
		
	The integer 12 is the first abundant number. Its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, and their sum is 28. 
	Because 28 is greater than 2 x 12, the number 12 is abundant. 
	It's abundant by is 28 - 24 = 4.
		
		
The program will determine if the given number is abundant, deficient or neither.
The program also has error checking and will only accept numbers between 1-1000.
Any other input that is not a number between 1-1000 will throw and error.
		
It starts off by waiting for user input. 
In both textbox's on the screen you input a number and hit "Calculate" button to determine what the number is.
You can reset the converter at any time to get back to the original state that the program started in.
		
		
Enjoy!
