**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**

I was bored, and wanted to keep my JavaScript programming skills sharpened over time, so I made this Rock Paper Scissors script!

The code contains HTML and Javascript that you can review in the Rock_Paper_Scissors.html file.

Double click (open) the file called Rock_Paper_Scissors.html in a browser so you can play Rock Paper Scissors!

This program was created for fun during my reading week break in University during 3rd year.
		
This game is normal Rock Paper Scissors and follows its normal rules, you can google Rock Paper Scissors wiki for the official rules
		
It starts off by waiting for user input in one of the squares and asks for you to choose either Rock, Paper, or Scissors button.
Once you choose one, you are compared against the AI's choice and the winner / loser / tie is determined.
You can continue to keep playing, reset at any time, and all error checking is handled.
		
Enjoy!
