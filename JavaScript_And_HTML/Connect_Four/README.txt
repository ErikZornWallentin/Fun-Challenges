**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**
I was bored, and wanted to keep my JavaScript programming skills sharpened over time, so I made this Connect Four game!

The code contains HTML and Javascript that you can review in the Connect_Four.html file.

Double click (open) the file called Connect_Four.html in a browser so you can play Connect Four!

If you are unfamiliar with the Connect Four game, look at this wiki for the rules:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four

Features: Allows 2 players to play, you can reset the game at any time, and it solves the game when its in a winning / losing / tie state

When someone wins, the game is over and you need to reset!
If all spots are filled, the game is in a TIE state and you need to reset!

Enjoy!
