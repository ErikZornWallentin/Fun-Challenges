**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**
I am a TA (Teaching Assistant) for the class CIS*1000 (Winter 2015 semester) and was requested to create a calculator
by my professor (Zoe Zhu) for the students to prepare for their 5th assignment. 

The code contains HTML and Javascript that you can review in the calculator.html file.

Double click (open) the file called calculator.html in a browser so you can use the Calculator!

Features: Most basic commands of a calculator, error testing!


Enjoy!
