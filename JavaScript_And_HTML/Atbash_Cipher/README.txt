**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**

This program was created to polish and improve my JavaScript programming skills.
		
This script is on Atbash Cipher, if you don't know what that is, see below link:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atbash
		
The program will use atbash cipher to convert English to Atbash or Atbash to English.
		
It starts off by waiting for user input.
In textbox on the screen you input a word and hit "Cipher" button to cipher the word!
You can reset the cipher at any time to get back to the original state that the program started in.
Program handles error checking for incorrect input, also will preserve uppercase or lowercase of letter.
		
Atbash is a simple substitution cipher originally for the Hebrew alphabet, but possible with any known alphabet. 
It emerged around 500-600 BCE. 
It works by substituting the first letter of an alphabet for the last letter, the second letter for the second to last and so on, effectively reversing the alphabet. 
Here is the Atbash substitution table:
		Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
		Cipher: zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba
		
Example Use of Atbash Cipher:
	foobar                                       ---> ullyzi
	wizard                                       ---> draziw
	gsrh rh zm vcznkov lu gsv zgyzhs xrksvi      ---> this is an example of the atbash cipher
		
		
		
Enjoy!
