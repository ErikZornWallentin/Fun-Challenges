**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**
I was bored, and wanted to keep my JavaScript programming skills sharpened over time, so I made this Memorize Pattern script!

The code contains HTML and Javascript that you can review in the Memorize_Pattern.html file.

Double click (open) the file called Memorize_Pattern.html in a browser so you can play Memorize Pattern!

Features: You play against the computer, score is calculated, reset game, error checking, fun :)

This program was created for fun during my reading week break in University during 3rd year.
It starts off by waiting for user input, to start the game.
When you click on "start" button it will show you a pattern, and after it is done you can input the pattern on the buttons.
You will see 1-4 numbers on the button that you click and this shows the order the pattern started in from 1-4 as 1 being the first one shown, and 4 the last one shown.
After you input the 4 numbers on the buttons, click "check" button and it will tell you if you are correct or not.
If you are correct you get 1 point on your score added onto it, if you are wrong your score goes back to 0, and you can play again no matter what
You can also reset the game by pressing the reset button.

Enjoy!
