**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**
I am a TA (Teaching Assistant) for the class CIS*1000 (Winter 2016 semester) and was requested to create a game
by my professor (Zoe Zhu) for the students to complete as a bonus assignment. The game I created was TicTacToe
where I created a template as a base and a tutorial for the students to follow in pdf or word format and the tutorial
shows how to create the Javascript game. This bonus assignment was accepted by the professor and is now being used!

The code contains HTML and Javascript that you can review in the TicTacToe_Perfect file.

Double click (open) the file called TicTacToe_Perfect.html in a browser so you can play TicTacToe!

Features: Allows 2 players to play, you can reset the game at any time, and can set new symbols for a both players!

When someone wins, the game is over and you need to reset!
If all spots are filled, the game is in a TIE state and you need to reset!

Enjoy!
