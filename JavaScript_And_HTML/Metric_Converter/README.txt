Running the program(s) and GENERAL INFO FOR ANY READER 
*********************************************************************

**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**

This program was created to polish and improve my JavaScript programming skills.
		
The script is on Metric Conversion, if you don't know what that is, see below link:
www.metric-conversions.org/length/kilometers-to-meters.htm

		
The program will calculate Kilometre to Metre, and Metre to Kilometre.
The program also handled error checking, it will give an error on blank input, or characters.
Also it will solve any calculations before doing the conversion in the input box.
		
It starts off by waiting for user input. 
In both textbox's on the screen you input a number and hit "Calculate" button to calculate Metric Conversion!
You can reset the converter at any time to get back to the original state that the program started in.
		
		
		
Enjoy!
