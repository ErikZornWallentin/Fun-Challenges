**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**

I was bored, and wanted to keep my JavaScript programming skills sharpened over time, so I made this Guess Square script!

The code contains HTML and Javascript that you can review in the Guess_Square.html file.

Double click (open) the file called Guess_Square.html in a browser so you can play Guess Square!

Features: You play against the computer, score is calculated, reset game, error checking, fun :)

This game is a luck based game, the odds are not in your favour and you will lose most the time.
		
It starts off by waiting for user input in one of the squares and asks for you to guess after you chosen a square
When you click on "guess" button it will show you a chosen square and let you know if you guessed correctly or not.
		Correct Guess: +3 points         Incorrect Guess: -1 point
After it lets you know if you won or not, you can play again or reset the game at any time.

Enjoy!
