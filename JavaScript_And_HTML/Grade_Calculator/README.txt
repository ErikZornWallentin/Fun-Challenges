**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**

I was bored, and wanted to keep my JavaScript programming skills sharpened over time, so I made this Grade Calculator script!

The code contains HTML and Javascript that you can review in the Grade_Calculator.html file.

Double click (open) the file called Grade_Calculator.html in a browser so you can use the Grade Calculator!

Features: Add up your grades, see your final mark, reset the calculator

Use: 	Input your grades and when you are ready to check your grade, hit calculate! 
		You can also reset the calculator at any time!

Enjoy!
