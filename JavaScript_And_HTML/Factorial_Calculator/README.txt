**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**

I was bored, and wanted to keep my JavaScript programming skills sharpened over time, so I made this Factorial script!

The code contains HTML and Javascript that you can review in the Factorial_Calculator.html file.

Double click (open) the file called Factorial_Calculator.html in a browser so you can try the Factorial Calculator!

This program was created to polish and improve my JavaScript programming skills.
		
This is Factorial, if you don't know what that is see link:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial
		
		
It starts off by waiting for user input. 
In the textbox on the screen you input a number and hit "Calculate" button to calculate factorial!
		
		
		
Enjoy!
