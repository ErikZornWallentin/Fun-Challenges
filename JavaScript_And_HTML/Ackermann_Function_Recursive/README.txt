**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**

I was bored, and wanted to keep my JavaScript programming skills sharpened over time, so I made this Ackermann Function script!

The code contains HTML and Javascript that you can review in the Ackermann_Function_Recursive.html file.

Double click (open) the file called Ackermann_Function_Recursive.html in a browser so you can try Ackermann Function!

This program was created for fun during my reading week break in University during 3rd year.
		
This is Ackermann Function, if you don't know what that is see link:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function

This implementation of Ackermann Function uses RECURSION.
		
		
It starts off by waiting for user input in M or N text boxes.
Once you give a numerical value, and press the calculate button it will calculate the result for you.
If you use low values from 0-3 in M and N it will calculate it almost instantly.
If the values are above that you may be waiting for minutes or longer!
		
If you use values above 4, 4 it may even crash and never work in JavaScript. 
This is intended as JavaScript is not a very good language to calculate Ackermann Function in!
		

Example use 1:

	M: 1
	N: 1
	Result: 3

Example use 2:
	
	M: 2
	N: 2
	Result: 7
	
Example use 3:
	M: 4
	N: 4
	Result: After 30min of waiting I gave up...it was unable to do this calculating in a timely fashion
		
Enjoy!
