**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**

This program was created to polish and improve my JavaScript programming skills.
		
This is a known game called Hangman where you guess a word and try to get it correct from using letters.
The letters you get incorrect puts you closer to losing, while correct letters gets you closer to winning.
When you win you can reset the game to try a new word.
Also you can SHOW your word at any time for hints!
		
If you are not familiar with Hangman, check out the rules here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman

I was lazy and never made the "Man", so you get 5 attempts per word to guess it correctly before you lose!
The script was more about the logic behind solving the game, not about drawing stuff in JavaScript.
		
It starts off by waiting for user input, and you have 5 attempts left to win the game.
In the textbox on the screen you will see a blank name, and all the letters of the alphabet will be shown also.
Click on a letter to guess if it was in the word or not, if it was not you your attempt score goes down,
and if you are correct the letters will show up!
You can reset the game at any time, or show the word at any time!
		
		
		
Enjoy!
